  <body>
    <h1>First Step, Get CompTIA Security+</h1>
  <p id="demo">
  The CompTIA Security+ Covers the first three topics of the CCNP Exam.
  It is also one of the starting certifications needed to get into an
  an entry level IT company. Read my other website on how to land your
  first IT job with CompTIA Security+ located on my website list above.
  </p>
   <h2> Second Step, Pass CCNA Routing switching.</h2>
   <p id='demo'>Even though you can take the CCNP Security In one go, I do not
     recommend it. On Cisco's website, you are recommended to have CCNA
     Routing and Switching in order to be familiar with learning basic
     Cisco IOS configuration.
